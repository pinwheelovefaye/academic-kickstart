I am a Research Scientist in the [Biostatistics Group at KAUST](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/biostats). I am a statistician with research interest in demography and global health.

I have been collaborating with UNICEF, specifically the [UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation](https://childmortality.org/), since 2012 on developing statistical models to estimate child and adolescent mortality disparities between sex, economic status, and place of residence. I have also been working with the UN Population Division since 2013 on estimating and projection sex ratio at birth using Bayesian approaches.

I have published in journals such as *Lancet Global Health*, *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, and *PLoS ONE*.

Fengqing is my given name, and the closest English pronunciation is "Fung-Ching". Chao is my family name, pronounced as it is spelled.

My CV is available [here](https://www.fengqingchao.com/files/cv_CHAOFENGQING.pdf). My KAUST profile is [here](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/biostats/people/person/fengqing-chao).
