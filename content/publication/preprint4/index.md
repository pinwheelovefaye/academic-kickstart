abstract: Pakistan has a strong preference for boys over girls; previous evidence on sex preference is primarily reported at the postnatal stage in which the child mortality rate is higher for females than males. Prenatal sex discrimination in Pakistan, reflected in the inflated sex ratio at birth (SRB; ratio of male to female births) has been barely mentioned before this study. We estimate the SRB and missing female births in Pakistan provinces from 1980 to 2020 and identify provinces with imbalanced SRB. We provide scenario-based projections of missing female births in provinces without the existing SRB inflation. An extensive SRB database of 832,091 birth records was compiled from all available surveys and censuses. To synthesize different data sources and provide annual estimates and their associated uncertainties of SRBs across provinces, we adopted a Bayesian hierarchical time series model. As per our model, Balochistan has had SRB imbalance since 1980. The maximum SRB was estimated as 1.121 (95% credible interval [1.066; 1.142]) in 1997. Assuming different start year of SRB inflation process in provinces without existing imbalance, the largest female birth deficit is projected to be 76.2 thousand in Punjab in 2033 when the SRB inflation starts in 2021. This is the first study on estimating the SRB from 1980 to 2020 and providing scenario-based projections of missing female births up to 2050 by Pakistan province. We identified the Balochistan province with imbalanced SRB and demonstrated important disparities in the occurrence and quantity of female birth deficits before 2050.
