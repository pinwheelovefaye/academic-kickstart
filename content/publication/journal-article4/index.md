abstract: We identify 12 countries with strong statistical evidence of SRB imbalance during 1970--2017, resulting in 45.0 (95% uncertainty interval [36.4; 54.8]) million missing female births globally. The majority of those missing female births are in China, with 23.1 [16.5; 30.7] million, and in India, with 20.7 [15.5; 26.6] million.

# summary: This study provides information on sex ratio at birth (SRB) reference levels and SRB imbalance.
