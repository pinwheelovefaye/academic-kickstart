abstract: Sex ratio at birth (SRB) is an important indicator to monitor prenatal sex discrimination. We provide a set of national and subnational analyses to estimate and project SRB based on reliable data and statistical models, with a focus on assessing SRB imbalance and sex-selective abortion. We take account of the data quality that varies across different sources as well as infer the levels and trends of indicators in countries and periods with limited data by data-rich country-years. The resulting estimates provide new insights into the SRB globally and sub-nationally in Asian countries with imbalanced SRB. The methods and results have been used by international agencies for policy making.
